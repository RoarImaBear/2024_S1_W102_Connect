# Welcome to Connect!

Connect is a social networking platform designed to connect travellers with locals. Developed by Sebastian Dymanski, Azel Saralaeva, Phoebe Sunata and James Hodder, it's the seed of a future Fortune500 and hopefully an 'A+'.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Using the app

> npm install (to download node_modules and dependencies)
> npm run start (starts application in web browser)
> create new account using an email and password or log in with existing credentials
> update your profile in the profile tab, using a url for the profile picture
> feed page allows you to "connect" with other users and choose from possible users
> matches page shows your current matches
> When clicking on a "Match" card it will open up "Messages" with that specific User
> "Enter" or click "Send" for you to be able to message the Match
>
> - or - (accept or decline) user match request

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies required to run the app locally.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
